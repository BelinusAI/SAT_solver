# SAT_solver
Satisfiability solver or SAT solver is a classic tool that works on Boolean formulas. 
Given a formula, either the solver finds Boolean variable values that make the formula true, or the solver indicates that no solution exists.

I work with conjunctive normal form (CNF): In this form, we say that a literal is a variable or the not of a variable. Then a clause is a multiway or of literals, and a CNF formula is a multiway and of clauses.
